# discord_materia_blur
This is a theme based on Glasscord's [example theme](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord/tree/master/extras/discord_example_theme), adapted to fir Materia's color scheme.
The main "features" are the full blur and the perfect blend with KDE decorations (set to 50% opactity).

It really jsut made it for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/jucfap/plasma_unity_now_rule_3_compliant/) r/unixporn post and it really is not much... This is my first time editing CSS, so criticism is welcome :)
